# Number Palindrome Checker: Create a program that checks if a given number is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
# they are many ways to check for the palindrome number as well as methods but its one of the basic way to check without converting the int to string 

while True:
    num = int(input("\n\nEnter the number: "))
    original_num = num
    reverse_num = 0  # Corrected variable name
    
    while num > 0:
        digit = num % 10
        reverse_num = reverse_num * 10 + digit
        num = num // 10
        
    if original_num == reverse_num:
        print(f"\nThe {original_num} is palindrome")
    else:
        print(f"\nThe {original_num} is not a palindrome")
